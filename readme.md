- Elevator pitch:
The only thing more fun than tic tac toe 3 in a row is... tic tac toe 4 in a row! In this alternate version of the game, the board is 5x5 instead of 3x3, and a player has to get 4 in a row to win.  

- Tech stack:
HTML, CSS, and JS

- Wireframe:


- MVP goals:
1. Interactive game board that will alternate between players and check for all winning conditions.  
2. Pretty CSS styling with colors and shapes that pop and will make the player want to stay in the game for hours on end!

- Stretch goals:
1. An alternate version where each player only has 4 tokens total, and on the player's fifth move their first token disappears.
2. An option for a computer player that will select a space randomly.

- Potential roadblocks:
1. CSS styling is still my weak point (which is why I want to use this project specifically to improve that).
2. This board is larger with way more winning combinations, my JS functions will be more complicated and I need to do extensive testing to make sure the logic covers all possibilites and no edge cases are missed.
