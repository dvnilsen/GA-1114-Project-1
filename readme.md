# GA-1114-Project-1

## Elevator pitch:
The most epic showdowns on the playground or in the classroom - it's Connect Four!  Humilate your friends and foes alike, and become the champion who gets the satisfying privilege of pulling out the bottom of the board and watching all the pieces crash to the table in celebration of your total victory! 

## Tech stack:
HTML, CSS, and JS

## Wireframe:

## MVP goals:
1. Interactive game board that will alternate between players and check for all winning conditions.  
3. CSS styling with colors and shapes that mimic a real life connect 4 game.
4. A button that resets the board without refreshing the page.

## Stretch goals:
1. A clinking sound that plays each time a player "drops" a piece. 
2. Big clinky/crashy sound when a player wins and hits the "empty game pieces" button. 
3. An option for a computer that selects spaces at random. 

## Potential roadblocks:
1. CSS styling is still my weak point.  I want to make sure the game doesn't look like a webpage from the 90's. 
2. Connect Four has far more winning combinations and my JS code will have to account for much more logic per turn.  Extensive testing for edge cases will be needed throughout the build process.
