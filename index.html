    <h1>Let's Play Connect Four!!!!</h1>
    <p>The rules are simple: Click anywhere on a column and your piece will "fall" to the lowest available space.  (Note: Once a column is full, you can no longer click on it, please choose a different column).  <br>Player 1 is assigned red pieces. Player 2 is assigned black pieces. The first player to get four pieces of their color in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally), wins!  <br>If you would like to end the game and start a new one, press the "Reset Game" button below the game board at any time.  </p>
